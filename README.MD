My learning attempt at building a self driving agent for the game TrackMania.

It ideally only uses the visual input of the game to determine how to progress through a map. 

Requires quite a bit of manual setup, and is special cased for my dev env.  If there is additional interest I can work on expanding it to general platforms.
